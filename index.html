      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a new student trying to become a web developer</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I spent my childhood in a small town in Mexico before coming to the United States when I was 11 years old. I like to believe that I had a pretty good child hood without all the new technology and dangers of today's</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Before I spent all my time working a night job I enjoyed reading some good thriller books, a good TV show or movie as well as hang out with my German Sheperd dog! whom requires a lot of attention</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one where at some point I get to work from home and make my own schedule. I want to live life to the fullest but a job with a good salary would help.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live the city of Fontana in the state of California but I plan on one day moving somewhere with a colder weather. It is too hot here at times..</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The reason why I would like to become a web developer is the job security and maybe I will find a way to work from home so that I can spend the most time with my future family. It also feels very rewarding knowing  you can build something like a web page. And this is only after doing the first steps towards one.</p>
